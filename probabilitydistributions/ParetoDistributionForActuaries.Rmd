### The Pareto Type I distribution

<h5> The Pareto Type I distribution</h5>

The Pareto Type I distribution is 
a continuous distribution, parameterized with  the shape parameter $\alpha > 0$, and location parameter $x_\mathrm{m} > 0$.




#### Formulas

#### Parameters


*  ${\displaystyle x_{\mathrm {m} }>0}$ scale (real)
*  ${\displaystyle \alpha >0}$ shape (real)


#### Distribution

* <b>Support</b>\[{\displaystyle x\in [x_{\mathrm {m} },\infty )}\]
* <b>PDF</b>\[f_X(x) = {\displaystyle {\frac {\alpha x_{\mathrm {m} }^{\alpha }}{x^{\alpha +1}}}}\]
* <b>CDF </b>\[F_X(x) = {\displaystyle 1-\left({\frac {x_{\mathrm {m} }}{x}}\right)^{\alpha }}\]
* <b>Quantile</b>\[Q_p = {\displaystyle x_{\mathrm {m} }{(1-p)}^{-{\frac {1}{\alpha }}}}\]


#### Method of Moments
\[{ \displaystyle
\frac{\operatorname{Var}(X)}{ E(X)^2} = \frac
{\frac{\lambda ^{2}\alpha }{(\alpha -1)^{2}(\alpha -2)}}{ \frac{\lambda^2}{(\alpha -1)^2}}  = \frac{\alpha}{\alpha-2}}\]




#### Cumulative distribution function

The cumulative distribution function of a Pareto random variable with parameters $\alpha$ and $x_m$ is
\[F_X(x) = \begin{cases}
1-\left(\frac{x_\mathrm{m}}{x}\right)^\alpha & \mbox{for } x \ge x_\mathrm{m}, \\
0 & \mbox{for }x < x_\mathrm{m}.
\end{cases}
\]


#### The mean excess loss function
Suppose that a property owner is exposed to a random loss X. The property owner buys an insurance policy with a deductible d such that the insurer will pay a claim in the amount of $X-d$ if a loss occurs with $Y>d$. 

The insurer will pay nothing if the loss is below the deductible. Whenever a loss is above $d$, what is the average claim the insurer will have to pay? This is one way to look at ***mean excess loss function***, which represents the expected excess loss over a threshold conditional on the event that the threshold has been exceeded. 

Thus the mean excess loss function is \[e_Y(d)=E(Y-d \lvert X>d),\] a function of the deductible $d$.


#### Formulas
* The mean excess loss for Pareto Type I is \[e(X)=d/(\alpha-1)\]
* The mean excess loss for Pareto Type II is \[e(X)=(d+\theta)/(\alpha-1).\]


They are both increasing functions of the deductible $d$. This means that the larger the deductible, the larger the expected claim if such a large loss occurs. If a random loss is modeled by such a distribution, it is a catastrophic risk situation.


In general, an increasing mean excess loss function is an indication of a heavy tailed distribution. On the other hand, a decreasing mean excess loss function indicates a light tailed distribution. The exponential distribution has a constant mean excess loss function and is considered a medium tailed distribution.



### Exercises

<h4> Worked Examples</h4>

<h5> Exercises 28</h5>
The random variable X is an insurerâ€™s annual hurricane-related loss. Suppose that the density function of X is:
	\[
	\displaystyle  f(x)=\left\{ \begin{array}{ll}                     \displaystyle  \frac{2.2 \ (250)^{2.2}}{x^{3.2}} &\ X > 250 \\           \text{ } & \text{ } \\           \displaystyle  0 &\ \text{otherwise}           \end{array} \right.
	\]
Calculate the inter-quartile range of annual hurricane-related loss.
