### Compund Poisson Distributions

<h4>Compund Poisson Distributions</h4>

A compound Poisson distribution is the probability distribution of the sum of a number of independent identically-distributed random variables, where the number of terms to be added is itself a Poisson-distributed variable. In the simplest cases, the result can be either a continuous or a discrete distribution.
<p>
When $N$ is Poisson, the expected value and the variance of the compound distribution are

\[ {\LARGE \operatorname {E} (Y)=\operatorname {E} (N)\operatorname {E} (X),} \] . \[{\LARGE \operatorname {Var} (Y)=E(N)(\operatorname {Var} (X)+{E(X)}^{2})=E(N){E(X^{2})}.} \]



### Worked Examples

<h3> Worked Example 1</h3>
The number of claims arising in one year from a group of policies follows a Poisson
distribution with mean 12. The claim sizes independently follow an exponential
distribution with mean \$80 and they are independent of the number of claims.
The current financial year has six months remaining.

<h4> Exercises </h4>
* Calculate the mean and the standard deviation of the total claim amount which arises
during this remaining six months.
