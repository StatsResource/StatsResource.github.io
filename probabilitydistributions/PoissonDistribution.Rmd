### Worked Examples

<h5>Worked Examples 1 </h5>

On the average 8 calls per hour are received in a telephone board. Assuming that the
number of calls received in the board in a given length of time is a Poisson process, find
the probability that

### Confidence Intervals for Poisson Random Variables

<h3> Worked Example 1</h3>

It is assumed that claims on a certain type of policy arise as a Poisson process with
claim rate $\lambda$ per year.


For a group of 150 independent policies of this type, the total number of claims during
the last calendar year was recorded as 123.
Determine an approximate 95\% confidence interval for the true underlying annual
claim rate for such a policy.

<h3> Worked Example 2</h3>

It is assumed that the numbers of claims arising in one year from motor insurance
policies for young male drivers and young female drivers are distributed as Poisson
random variables with parameters $ \lambda_m$ and $\lambda_f$ respectively.

Independent random samples of 120 policies for young male drivers and 80 policies
for young female drivers were examined and yielded the following mean number of
claims per policy in the last calendar year: $ x_m = 0.24$ and $\LARGE x_f = 0.15$ .

Calculate an approximate 95% confidence interval for $\LARGE \bar{x}_{m} - \bar{x}_{f}$ , the difference between
the respective Poisson parameters.
