### Uniform Distribution

### Continuous Uniform distribution


* [L] lower bound of an interval
* [U] upper bound of an interval

Probability of an outcome being between lower bound L and upper bound U
\[P( L \leq X \leq U)  =  { U - L \over  b â€“ a }\]



<h5>Reminder</h5>

* " $\leq$" is less than or equal to

* " $\geq$" is greater than or equal to

* $L \leq X \leq U$ simply states that X is between L and U inclusively.

("inclusively" mean that X could be exactly L or U also, although the probability of this is extremely low)

### Distributional Formulas

The probability density function is given as

\[f(x) = {1 \over b-a} for a \leq x \leq b\]

For any value "c" between the minimum value a and the maximum value b

\[P(X \ geq c) = {b-c \over b-a}\]

here b is the upper bound while c is the lower bound


\[P(X \ leq c) = {c-a \over b-a}\]

here c is the upper bound while a is the lower bound
