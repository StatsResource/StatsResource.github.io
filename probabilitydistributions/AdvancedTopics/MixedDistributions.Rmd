### Worked Examples

<h5>Mixed Probability Distributions</h5>

There are two continuous probability distributions:

* A is an exponential distribution with mean $\LARGE \mu = 7$.
* B is a distribution that is uniform on the interval from 0 to 8, and thereafter proportional
to A.

Show that the probability of a random variable that follows distribution B and lying
between 0 and 8 is 8/15
