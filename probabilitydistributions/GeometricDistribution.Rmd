### Geometric Distribution

<h4> Geometric Distribution </h4>


	
*  Geometric distributions model (some) discrete random variables.
*  The geometric distribution is used for Bernouilli Trials, where there outcome are classified as either failures or successes.
*  Typically, a Geometric random variable is the number of trials required to obtain the first \textbf{success}.
*  For example, the number of tosses of a coin untill the first 'tail' is obtained, or a process where components from a production line are tested, in turn, until the first defective item is found.
	


*   The Geometric distribution is related to the Binomial distribution in that
		both are based on independent trials in which the probability of success
		is constant and equal to p.
*   However, a Geometric random variable is the number of trials until the
		first failure, whereas a Binomial random variable is the number of
		successes in n trials.
*   The Geometric distributions is often used in IT security applications.



--------------------------------------------

<h4> Assumptions</h4>

The trials must meet the following requirements:

1. the total number of trials is potentially infinite;
2. there are just two outcomes of each trial; success and failure;
3. the outcomes of all the trials are statistically independent;
4. all the trials have the same probability of success.

------------------------------------------------

#### Bernouilli Trials

*  Now consider an experiment with only two outcomes. 
* Independent repeated trials of such an experiment are called Bernoulli trials, named after the Swiss mathematician Jacob Bernoulli (16541705). 
* The term \textbf{\emph{independent trials}} means that the outcome of any trial does not depend on the previous outcomes (such as tossing a coin).
*  We will call one of the outcomes the "success" and the other outcome the "failure".




### The Geometric Distribution 


<h4> Types of Geometric Distribution</h4>

In probability theory, the geometric distribution is either of two discrete probability distributions:

*  The probability distribution of the number of trials needed to get first success, supported on the set $\{ 1, 2, 3, \ldots\}$
*  The probability distribution of the number of failures before the first success, supported on the set $\{ 0, 1, 2, 3, \ldots\}$
	
*  Which of these one calls "the" geometric distribution is a matter of convention and convenience. 
* A solution for one can quickly be surmised from the other.
*  These two different geometric distributions should not be confused with each other. 
*  Often, the name shifted geometric distribution is adopted for the former one (distribution of the number X); 
*  however, to avoid ambiguity, it is considered wise to indicate which is intended, by mentioning the support explicitly.
	
*  It’s the probability that the first occurrence of success require k number of independent trials, each with success probability p. 
	
*  If the probability of success on each trial is p, then the probability that the kth trial (out of k trials) is the first success is
	\[  P(X = k) = (1-p)^{k-1}\,p\, \phantom{space} for k = 1, 2, 3, \ldots \]
	
	
*  The above form of geometric distribution is used for modeling the number of trials until the first success. 
	
*  By contrast, the following form of geometric distribution is used for modeling number of failures until the first success:
	\[ P(Y=k) = (1 - p)^k\,p\, \phantom{space} for k = 0, 1, 2, 3, \ldots\]
	
* 
	In either case, the sequence of probabilities is a geometric sequence.
	
*  For example, suppose an ordinary die is thrown repeatedly until the first time a "1" appears. 
*  The probability distribution of the number of times it is thrown is supported on the infinite set ${ 1, 2, 3, \ldots }$ and is a geometric distribution with p = 1/6.
	
* The expected value of a geometrically distributed random variable X is 1/p and the variance is $(1 - p)/p^2$:
	\[ \mathrm{E}(X) = \frac{1}{p}, \qquad\mathrm{var}(X) = \frac{1-p}{p^2}. \]
*  Similarly, the expected value of the geometrically distributed random variable Y (where Y corresponds to the pmf listed in the right column) is (1 - p)/p, 
	and its variance is (1 - p)/p2:
	\[ \mathrm{E}(Y) = \frac{1-p}{p}, \qquad\mathrm{var}(Y) = \frac{1-p}{p^2}.\]
	
	
<h4>Type I Distribution<h4>

*  A Geometric random variable is the number of trials until the first \textit{\textbf{success}}, whereas a Binomial random variable is the number of successes in $n$ trials.



A discrete random variable X is said to follow a Geometric distribution with parameter p, written \[X \sim Geo(p),\] if it has probability distribution
\[P(X=x) = p^{x-1}(1-p)^x\]
where

*  $x = 0, 1, 2, 3, \ldots$
*  p = success probability; $0 < p < 1$



\[ P(X = n) = (1-p)^{n-1}p \]

\[ P(X > n) = (1-p)^n \]




*  $ E[X] = 1/p $
	
*  The variance of the geometric distribution is 
	\[\operatorname{Var}(X) = (1-p)/p^2\].	




### Type I Distribution

<h4>Type I Geometric Distribution</h4>
* Geometric distributions model (some) discrete random variables. 
* Typically, a Geometric random variable is the number of trials required to obtain the first failure, for example, the number of tosses of a coin until the first 'tail' is obtained, or a process where components from a production line are tested, in turn, until the first defective item is found.

* A discrete random variable X is said to follow a Geometric distribution with parameter $p$, written $X \sim Ge(p)$, if it has probability distribution
\[P(X=x) = p^{x-1}(1-p)^x\]
where

* $x = 1, 2, 3, \ldots$

* p = success probability; $0 < p < 1$

* The Geometric distribution has expected value and variance  \[E(X)= 1/(1-p)\] \[V(X)=p/{(1-p)^2}\].

---------------------------------------------

#### Mean and Variance

If X has a geometric distribution with parameter $p$, we write
\[X \sim Geo(p) \]
Expectation and Variance
If $X \sim Geo(p)$, then:


*  Expected Value of X : $E(X) = 1/p$
*  Variance of X : $Var(X) = (1-p)/p^2$.

<h4> Formulas</h4>

A discrete random variable X is said to follow a Geometric distribution with parameter $p$, written $X \sim Ge(p)$, if it has probability distribution
	\[P(X=x) = p^{x-1}(1-p)^x\]
	where
	
*   $x = 1, 2, 3, \ldots$
*   p = success probability; $0 < p < 1$
	


The Type 2 Geometric distribution has expected value and variance  \[E(X)= {1\over(1-p)}\] \[V(X)=\frac{p}{{(1-p)^2}}\].





	



### Type II Distribution




Suppose that a random experiment has two possible outcomes, success
with probability p and failure with probability 1-p .


The experiment is repeated until a success happens. The number of
trials before the success is a random variable X computed as follows

\[P(X = k) = (1-p)^{(k-1)}\times p \]


(i.e. The probability that first success is on the k-th trial)

### Derivation

<h4> Derivation</h4>

*  Suppose that I am at a party and I start asking girls to dance. Let X be the number of girls that I need to ask in order to find a partner. If the first girl accepts, then X=1. If the first girl declines but the next girl accepts, then X=2. And so on. 
	
*  When X=n, it means that I failed on the first n-1 tries and succeeded on the nth try. My probability of failing on the first try is (1-p). My probabilty of failing on the first two tries is (1-p)(1-p). 
	
	
*  My probability of failing on the first n-1 tries is (1-p)n-1. Then, my probability of succeeding on the nth try is p. Thus, we have 
	
	\[ P(X = n) = (1-p)^{n-1}p \]
	
*  This is known as the geometric distribution. When you have a sequence of numbers in which the (n+1)th number is a multiple of the nth number, it is called a geometric sequence. In this case, P(X = n+1) is a multiple of P(X = n). (What is that multiple?) 
	
*  What is the probability that it will take more than n tries to succeed? We know that if I ask an infinite number of girls to dance, eventually one of them will accept. So, the probability that it will take more than n tries is the same as the probability that I fail n times. That is, 
	
	\[ P(X > n) = (1-p)^n \]
	
	If X is geometric with parameter p, what is E(X)? 
	
*  We are faced with an infinite sum. Multiplying X times P(X) for X = 1, 2, 3, ... gives 
	
	\[
	[1] S = p + 2p(1-p) + 3p(1-p)2 +...+np(1-p)n-1 
	\]
*  Multiply both sides by (1-p) and you have
	
	[2] (1-p)S = p(1-p) + 2p(1-p)2 + 3p(1-p)3 +...+np(1-p)n 
	

	
*  Subtracting [2] from [1] gives 
	
	\[S - (1-p)S = pS = p[1 + (1-p) + (1-p)2 + ...(1-p)n] = p(1/p) = 1
	S = 1/p \]
	
*  Therefore, the mean of the geometric distribution is equal to 1/p. If we are trying to estimate how many girls I will have to ask to dance until I find a partner, and p, the probability of one girl accepting, is .2, then on average I will have to ask five girls. 
	You will not have to know it, but for the record, the variance of the geometric distribution is (1-p)/p2.
