### Important Formulas

<h3>The Exponential Distribution</h3>
<p>
<h5>Probability density function of the Exponential Distribution</h5>

\noindent The probability density function (pdf) of an exponential distribution is
\[  {\displaystyle f(x;\lambda )={\begin{cases}\lambda e^{-\lambda x}&x\geq 0,\\0&x<0.\end{cases}}}\]

Here $\lambda  > 0$ is the parameter of the distribution, often called the rate parameter.


### Exponential Distribution
The Exponential Distribution may be used to answer the following questions:

* How much time will elapse before an earthquake occurs in a given region?
* How long do we need to wait before a customer enters our shop?
* How long will it take before a call center receives the next phone call?
* How long will a piece of machinery work without breaking down?



* All these questions concern the time we need to wait before a given event occurs. If this waiting time is unknown, it is often appropriate to think of it as a random variable having an exponential distribution.
* Roughly speaking, the time $X$ we need to wait before an event occurs has an exponential distribution if the probability that the event occurs during a certain time interval is proportional to the length of that time interval.



#### Exponential Distribution Lifetimes
The average lifespan of a laptop is 5 years. You may assume that
the lifespan of computers follows an exponential probability
distribution. \begin{itemize}\item (3 marks) What is the
probability that the lifespan of the laptop will be at least 6
years? * 
What is the probability that the lifespan of the laptop will not
exceed 4 years? *(3 marks) What is the probability of the
lifespan being between 5 years and 6 years?

Suppose the lifetime of a PC is exponentially distributed with
mean $\mu =5$
We should be told the average lifetime $\mu$.
\[
P( X \geq x_o) = e^{{-x_o \over \mu}}
\]

###  Review Questions

<h3> Review Question 1</h3>

Beginning the observation at any point in time, what is the probability that the first call for service will arrive within five minutes?
Jobs are sent to a printer at an average of 5 jobs per hour. 

a. What is the expected time between jobs? 
b. What is the probability that the next job is sent within 6 minutes after the previous job?

---------------------------

<h3> Review Question 2</h3>

Assume that the time, denominated in minutes, between arrivals of customers at a particular bank is exponentially distributed with a rate parameter of 0.25. 


a. What is the mean duration between arrivals?
b. Find the probability that the time between arrivals is greater than 5 minutes.
c. Find the probability that the time between arrivals will be less than 2 minute.

---------------------------

<h3> Review Question 3</h3>

Suppose that customers arrive at a filling station at the rate of 3 per hour. Given that a customer has just arrived, the time is takes for the next customer to arrive is called a ***waiting time***}. Let $ T$ be the symbol for the ``waiting times" variable. 
<p>
Suppose that a customer has just arrived.

a. What is the expected waiting time between customer arrivals? 
b. Compute $E(T)$
c. What is the variance of waiting times? \subitem Compute $\mbox{Var}(T)$.
d. What is the probability that the next customer will arrive within the next fifteen minutes?
e. What is the probability that no customers arrive in the next half hour?
