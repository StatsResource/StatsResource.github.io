### Important Formulas

<h5>Probability density function of the Exponential Distribution<h5>

\noindent The probability density function (pdf) of an exponential distribution is
\[ \LARGE {\displaystyle f(x;\lambda )={\begin{cases}\lambda e^{-\lambda x}&x\geq 0,\\0&x<0.\end{cases}}}\]

Here $\LARGE \lambda  > 0$ is the parameter of the distribution, often called the rate parameter.

### Worked Examples

<h3> Worked Examples</h3>

Claim amounts are modelled as an exponential random variable with mean \$1,000.

<h4> Exercises </h4>

a. Calculate the probability that one such claim amount is greater than \$5,000.

b. Calculate the probability that a claim amount is greater than \$5,000 given that
it is greater than \$1,000.

###  Review Questions

<h3> Review Question 1</h3>

An average of five calls per hour are received by a machine repair department. 
Beginning the observation at any point in time, what is the probability that the first call for service will arrive within five minutes?
Jobs are sent to a printer at an average of 5 jobs per hour. 

a. What is the expected time between jobs? 
b. What is the probability that the next job is sent within 6 minutes after the previous job?

---------------------------

<h3> Review Question 2</h3>

Assume that the time, denominated in minutes, between arrivals of customers at a particular bank is exponentially distributed with a rate parameter of 0.25. 


a. What is the mean duration between arrivals?
b. Find the probability that the time between arrivals is greater than 5 minutes.
c. Find the probability that the time between arrivals will be less than 2 minute.

---------------------------

<h3> Review Question 3</h3>

Suppose that customers arrive at a filling station at the rate of 3 per hour. Given that a customer has just arrived, the time is takes for the next customer to arrive is called a ***waiting time***}. Let $\LARGE T$ be the symbol for the ``waiting times" variable. 
<p>
Suppose that a customer has just arrived.

a. What is the expected waiting time between customer arrivals? 
b. Compute $E(T)$
c. What is the variance of waiting times? \subitem Compute $\mbox{Var}(T)$.
d. What is the probability that the next customer will arrive within the next fifteen minutes?
e. What is the probability that no customers arrive in the next half hour?
