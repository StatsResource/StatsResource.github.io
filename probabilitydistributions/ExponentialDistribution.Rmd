### Important Formulas

<h5>Probability density function of the Exponential Distribution<h5>

\noindent The probability density function (pdf) of an exponential distribution is
\[ \LARGE {\displaystyle f(x;\lambda )={\begin{cases}\lambda e^{-\lambda x}&x\geq 0,\\0&x<0.\end{cases}}}\]

Here $\LARGE \lambda  > 0$ is the parameter of the distribution, often called the rate parameter.

### Worked Examples

<h3> Worked Examples</h3>

Claim amounts are modelled as an exponential random variable with mean \$1,000.

<h4> Exercises </h4>

a. Calculate the probability that one such claim amount is greater than \$5,000.

b. Calculate the probability that a claim amount is greater than \$5,000 given that
it is greater than \$1,000.

\section*{Exponential Distribution: Review Questions}
\begin{enumerate}
* 
An average of five calls per hour are received by a machine repair department. 
Beginning the observation at any point in time, what is the probability that the first call for service will arrive within five minutes?

*  Jobs are sent to a printer at an average of 5 jobs per hour. 
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
	*  What is the expected time between jobs? 
	*  What is the probability that the next job is sent within 6 minutes after the previous job?
\end{enumerate}

*  
Assume that the time, denominated in minutes, between arrivals of customers at a particular bank is exponentially distributed with a rate parameter of 0.25. 

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
    *  What is the mean duration between arrivals?
	* 
	Find the probability that the time between arrivals is greater than 5 minutes.
	* ]
	Find the probability that the time between arrivals will be less than 2 minute.
\end{enumerate}

*  Suppose that customers arrive at a filling station at the rate of 3 per hour. Given that a customer has just arrived, the time is takes for the next customer to arrive is called a \textbf{waiting time}. Let $T$ be the symbol for the ``waiting times" variable. 


Suppose that a customer has just arrived.
\begin{enumerate}[(a)] *  What is the expected waiting time between customer arrivals? 
\subitem Compute $E(T)$
*  What is the variance of waiting times? \subitem Compute $\mbox{Var}(T)$.
	*  What is the probability that the next customer will arrive within the next fifteen minutes?
	*  What is the probability that no customers arrive in the next half hour?
\end{enumerate}
