Huffman coding is a method of lossless data compression, and a form of entropy encoding. The basic idea is to map an alphabet to a representation for that alphabet, composed of strings of variable size, so that symbols that have a higher probability of occurring have a smaller representation than those that occur less often.

### Huffman encoding algorithm 
Huffman coding is an entropy encoding algorithm used for lossless data compression.\\
\bigskip
A frequency based coding scheme (algorithm) that follows Huffman's idea is called Huffman coding. Huffman coding is a simple algorithm that generates a set of variable-size codewords of the minimum average length. The algorithm for Huffman encoding involves the following steps:
<p>
\begin{itemize}
\item[1.] Frequency Table: Constructing a frequency table sorted in descending order.

\item[2.] Building a binary tree:
    Carrying out iterations until completion of a complete binary tree:

\item[(a)] Merge the last two items (which have the minimum frequencies) of    the frequency table to form a new combined item with a sum
    frequency of the two.

\item[(b)] Insert the combined item and update the frequency table.


\item[3.] Deriving Huffman tree:
Starting at the root, trace down to every leaf; mark �0� for a left branch and �1� for a right branch.

\item[4.] Generating Huffman code:
Collecting the 0s and 1s for each path from the root to a leaf and assigning a 0-1 codeword for each symbol.

\noindent \textbf{Data compression(2)}
The key approaches of data compression can be summarized as modelling + coding.
Modelling is a process of constructing a knowledge system for
performing compression. Coding includes the design of the code and product of the compact data form.
