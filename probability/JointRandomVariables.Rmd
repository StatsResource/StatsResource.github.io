### Worked Example 1

<h5> Joint Distribution of Random Variables  - Health Science Example </h5>
<strong><a href="https://youtu.be/M6iKFS8FaLg">Solution</a></strong>
<br><br>
Consider the random variable $\LARGE{X}$ taking the value $\LARGE{X = 1}$ if a randomly selected person
is a smoker, or $\LARGE{X = 0}$ otherwise. <br><br>

* The random variable $\LARGE{Y}$ describes the amount of
physical exercise per week for this randomly selected person. <p>

* It can take the values 0
(less than one hour of exercise per week), 1 (one to two hours) and 2 (more than two
hours of exercise per week).

<p>
The joint distribution of $\LARGE{X}$ and $\LARGE{Y}$ is given by the joint probability function in the
following table.

||| Y= 0 | Y= 1 | Y= 2|
|------:|------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|
||**X = 0** | 0.2 | 0.3 | 0.25|
||**X = 1** | 0.1 | 0.1 | 0.05|
||     |   |    |    |


<br><br>
The random variable $\LARGE{R = (3 - Y)^2(X + 1) }$ is used as a risk index for a particular heart disease.

<b> Exercises</b>

a. Calculate the probability that a randomly selected person does more than two
hours of exercise per week. 
b. Decide whether $\LARGE{X}$ and $\LARGE{Y}$ are independent or not and justify your answer. 
c. Derive the probability function of $\LARGE{R}$. 
d. Calculate the expectation of $\LARGE{R}$.
