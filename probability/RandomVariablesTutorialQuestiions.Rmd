Six horses are entered in a race. Larry picks two of the horses at random, and bets on them. 
How many ways are there of picking two horses at random from six?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<h3> Worked Example  2</h3>

Suppose a fair coin is tossed six times. The number of heads which can occur with their respective
probabilities follows:

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
xi	  |    0	  |    1	  |    2	  |    3	  |    4	  |    5	  |    6 |    | 
p(xi)	  |    1/64	  |    6/64	  |    15/64	  |    20/64	  |    15/64	  |    6/64	  |    1/64 |    | 
\end{tabular}

%------------------------------------%
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item	Compute the expected value (i.e. expected number of heads).
\item	Compute the variance of the heads.
\end{enumerate}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<h3> Worked Example  3</h3>

A player tosses two fair coins. He wins \$2 if two heads occur, and \$1 if one head occurs. On the other hand, he loses \$3 if no heads occur. Find the expected value E(X) of the game. Is the game fair? 

(The game is fair, favorable, or unfavorable to the player according as $E(X) = 0$,$E(X) > 0$ or $E(X) < 0$.)

<h3> Worked Example  4</h3>

A lottery with 500 tickets gives one prize of \$100, three prizes of \$50 each, and five prizes of \$25 each.

a. Find the expected winnings of a ticket. 
b. If a ticket costs \$1, what is the expected value of the game?

<h3> Worked Example  5</h3>
You develop a random number generater which assigns a value to the random variable $X$ according to the following probability distribution:

\begin{tabular}{|c|ccccc|}

  |     |     |     |     |   |    |[-0.4cm]
$x$   |    0.0   |    0.5   |    1.0   |    2.0   |    3.0 |    |

  |     |     |     |     |   |    |[-0.4cm]
$\Pr(X=x)$   |    $0.4$   |    $0.2$   |    $0.15$   |    $0.15$   |    $?$ |    |[0.1cm]


\end{tabular}

a. What is value the value of $\Pr(X = 3.0)$?  
b. Calculate $E(X)$ and $Sd(X)$.  
c. You produce a gambling game where the player wins (in euro) the value of $X$ generated, e.g., if a $2.0$ appears, \euro{2} is won. How much should you charge for a play of 
this game so that that \emph{you} (the programmer) make a profit of \euro{0.10} on average per game? (i.e., the player \emph{loses} \euro{0.10} on average)  
d. Using your answer to part (c), determine the probability that you make a profit when somebody plays this game.  
e. If 10 people play this game, what is the probability that you make a profit 8 times?

<h3> Worked Example  6</h3>
A random sample with replacement of size n = 2 is drawn from the set {1, 2, 3}, yielding the following
9-element sample space:

\[S = {(1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)}\]

Each pairing is equally probable. Let $X$ denote the sum of the two numbers. 

a. 
Construct a table that contains all the possible values of X and the probability of that outcome.
b. Compute the expected value $E(X)$.

<h3> Worked Example  7</h3>

<h3> Worked Example  8</h3>
For a particular Java assembler interface, the operand stack size has the
following probabilities:



|  |    |   |  |   |  |  |
|:-----------:|:-----------:|:-----------:|:-----------:|:-----------:|:-----------:|:-----------:|
| |		Stack Size    |    0   |    1   |    2   |    3   |    4 |    |

a. Calculate the expected stack size.
b. Calculate the variance of the stack size.

<h3> Worked Example  9</h3>
Orders for a computer are summarized by the number of optional
features that are requested as follows:

	\begin{tabular}{|c||c|c|c|c|c|}
		
		% after |    |:  or \cline{col1-col2} \cline{col3-col4} ...
		
		Number of optional features X   |    0   |    1   |    2  |    3   |    4 |    |
		Probability P(X)  |    0.35   |    0.25   |    0.20  |    0.10   |    0.10 |    |
