### Playing Card and Dice Questions

<h3> Worked Example 1</h3>
A card is drawn at random from a pack of cards. Let A be the event that the card is red
and B be the event that the card is king. 

Does the colour of card affect its probability of being a king?

### Independent Events

<h4> Independent Events</h4>
<p>
<h5>Worked Example 1</h5>
Suppose that A and B are two independent events with $P(A)$, the probability that A occurs, equal to 0.4, and $P(B)$, the probability that B occurs, equal to 0.5.
You may assume that A and B are independent events.
<p>
<h5> Exercises </h5> 
a. Calculate $P(A \cap B)$, the probability of both A and B occuring (i.e. simultaneously).
b. Calculate $P(A \cup B)$, the probability of either A and B (or both) occuring.

<h5>Worked Example 2</h5>

Suppose that $A$ and $B$ are events from a sample space such that $P(A) = 0.65$ and $P(B) =0.45$ and $P(A\cap B) = 0.32$

<h5> Exercises </h5> 
a. Find $P(B^{c})$.
b. Find $P(B|A)$.
c. Find $P(A \;\cup\;B)$.
d. Find $P(A^{c} \;\cup\;B^{c})$.
