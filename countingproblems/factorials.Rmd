### Factorials Numbers

A factorial is a positive whole number, based on a number $n$ , and which is written as $``n!"$. The factorial $n!$ is defined as follows:

\[n!  =n \times (n-1) \times (n-2) \times \ldots \times 2 \times 1 \]

Remark $n!  =n \times (n-1)!$\\ \bigskip

#### Example: 


* $3!  = 3 \times 2  \times 1 = 6 $

* $4!  = 4 \times 3! = 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 24$

Remark $0! = 1$ not $0$.
