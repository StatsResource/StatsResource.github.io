### Permutation Formula

A formula for the number of possible permutations of k objects from a set of n. This is usually written $^nP_k$ .


#### Formula:
\[ ^nP_k = \frac{n!}{(n-k)!} =  n.(n-1).(n-2).\ldots(n-k+1) \]

#### Worked Example 1: 
How many ways can 4 students from a group of 15 be lined up for a photograph?\\


There are $^{15}P_4$ possible permutations of 4 students from a group of 15.
\[ ^{15}P_4 = \frac{15!}{11!} = 15\times 14\times 13\times 12 = 32760 \]
There are 32760 different lineups.

#### Worked Example 2: 


How many ways are there of arranging 3 different jobs, between 5 workers, where each worker can only do one job?


\[ ^5 P_3 = \frac{5!}{(5-3)!}  = {5! \over 2!} = 60\]
