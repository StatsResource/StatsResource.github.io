### Continuous Uniform Distribution 

*  
The Uniform family of distributions model (some) continuous random variables and (some) discrete random variables. The values of a uniform random variable are uniformly distributed over an interval. 

* The continuous uniform distribution is very simple to understand and implement, and is commonly used in computer applications. This probability distribution is particularly useful in computer simulations. It is very simple to understand, and is a good starting place for learning about continuous probability distributions.
\textit{(It is also known as the `Rectangle Distribution' for obvious reasons)}.
* We specify the word ``continuous" so as to distinguish it from it's discrete equivalent: the discrete uniform distribution.\\ \textit{Remark; the dice distribution is a discrete uniform distribution with lower and upper limits 1 and 6 respectively.}
* 
For example, if buses arrive at a given bus stop every 8 minutes, and you arrive at the bus stop at a random time, the time you wait for the 
next bus to arrive could be described by a uniform distribution over the interval from 0 to 8.

### Parameters of the Uniform Distribution


* The uniform distribution is characterized by the two values, the \textbf{minimum} ($a$) and the \textbf{maximum} ($b$). Any value between $a$ and $b$ has an equal likelihood of occuring.
* When $X$ is a uniformly distributed random variables, we would describe it mathematically as follows:
\[ X \sim U(a,b). \]

* It is not possible to have an outcome that is lower than $a$ or larger than $b$.

\[ P(X < a) = P(X > b) = 0\] 

* In the absence of the specified upper and lower limits, the default values of 0 and 1 would be used.



% * The expected value E(x) is given by (i.e. the average of the maximum and minimum)
% \[ E(X) = {a+b \over 2}\]
% * The variance of the continuous uniform distribution is
% \[ V(X) = {(b-a)^2\over12}\]

\noindent A random variable X is called a continuous uniform random variable over the interval $(a,b)$ if it's probability density function is given by
\[ f_{X}(x) = { 1 \over b-a} \hspace{1cm} \mbox{ when } a \leq x \leq b \mbox{     (otherwise } f_X(x) = 0 ) \]
The corresponding cumulative density function is
\[ F_x(x) = { x-a \over b-a} \hspace{1cm} \mbox{ when } a \leq x \leq b\]




%---------------------------------------------------------------------------%
\subsection*{Sample Space}
\noindent Suppose that a continuous uniform distribution is characterized by the following parameter values:

* The lower limit $a = 3$. % (or with \texttt{R}: \texttt{\textbf{min}} )

* The upper limit $b = 6$. % (or with \texttt{R}: \texttt{\textbf{max}} )
* We denote $X$ as $X \sim U(3,6)$




% 
%* [a:] The lowest possible value of $X$ (i.e. the minimum)
%* [b:] The highest possible value of $X$ (i.e. the maximum)
%  
%------------------------------------------------------------------------%

*  The following values are possible outcomes: $3.14, \;3.78,\; 4.66,\; 5.8,\;5.9999.$ \smallskip
*  The probability of being exactly equal to $3$ or $6$ can be assumed to be zero. \smallskip
*  The following outcomes are not possible, either because they are too high or too low.
$1.67,\;2,\;67,\;7.14,\; 8.78.$

%========================================================================%



\subsection*{Interval Probability}


* We wish to compute the probability of an outcome being within a range of values.
* We shall call this lower bound of this range $L$ and the upper bound $ U$.
* Necessarily $L$ and $U$ must be possible outcomes.
* The probability of $X$ being between $L$ and $U$ is denoted $P( L \leq X \leq U )$.

\[
P( L \leq X \leq U ) = { U - L \over b - a}
\]
* \textit{(This equation is based on a definite integral)}.




%============================================================ %

\subsection*{Reminder}


* " $\leq$" is less than or equal to

* " $\geq$" is greater than or equal to


The mathematical statement
\[L \leq X \leq U\]

simply states that X is between L and U inclusively. $X$ could be exactly L or U also, although the probability of this is extremely low.




* For any value ``c" between the minimum value $a$ and the maximum
value $b$, we can express $P(X \leq c)$ as
\[P(X \leq c) = {c-a \over b-a}.\]
Here $c$ is the upper bound while $a$ is the lower bound.
* Similarly $P(X \geq c)$ \[P(X \geq c) = {b-c \over b-a}.\]
Here $b$ is the upper bound while $c$ is the lower bound.




### Continuous Uniform Distribution
A random variable X is called a continuous uniform random variable over the interval $(a,b)$ if it's probability density function is given by

\[ f_{X}(x)  =  { 1 \over b-a}   \hspace{2cm}  \mbox{ when } a \leq x \leq b\]

The corresponding cumulative density function is

\[ F_x(x) = { x-a \over b-a}   \hspace{2cm}  \mbox{ when } a \leq x \leq b\]

<p>

The mean of the continuous uniform distribution is

\[ E(X) = {a+b \over 2}\]

\[ V(X) = {(b-a)^2\over12}\]
}


###  Expected Value and Variance

The expected Value of a uniformly distributed random variable $X$, specifed with maximum value $b$ and minimum value $a$, i.e.
\[ X \sim U(a,b) \] is computed using the following formula
\[ E(X) = \frac{a+b}{2}. \]

The variance of the continuous uniform distribution, denoted $\textrm{Var}(X)$, is computed using the following formula

\[
\textrm{Var}(X) = {(b - a)^2 \over 12}
\]

Suppose $X \sim U(3,6)$ then
\[
\textrm{Var}(X) = {{(6 - 3)^2 \over 12} =  {3^2 \over 12} = {9 \over 12} = 0.75}
\]
