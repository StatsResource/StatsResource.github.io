		\textbf{The Permutation Formula}
		
		Oftne we are concerned with computing the number of ways of selecting and arranging groups of items. A \textbf{combination} when describing the selection of items from a larger group of items. A \textbf{Permutation} is a combination that is arranged in a particular way.
		
	}
	{
		
		The number of different permutations of r items from n unique items is written as $^n P_r$
		
		
		\[ ^n P_r = \frac{n!}{(n-r)!}\]
	}
	
	{
		\textbf{permutations}
		\textbf{Example:}
		How many ways are there of arranging 3 different jobs, between 5 workers, where each worker can only do one job?
		
		
		\[ ^5 P_3 = \frac{5!}{(5-3)!}  = {5! \over 2! = 60}\]
		
	}
		
	
	\textbf{Permutations}
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The number of permutations of n objects is the number of ways in which the objects can be arranged in
		terms of order: \item
		Permutations of n objects : \[n! = (n) \times (n - 1) \times (n-2) \ldots  \times 2 \times 1 \]
		\item
		
		The symbol n! is read ``n factorial". 
		\item In permutations and combinations problems, n is always positive.
		Also, note that by definition $0! = 1$ in mathematics.
	\end{itemize}
