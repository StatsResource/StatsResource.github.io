* There are two families of Probability Distributions: the discrete and the continuous families.
* The <em><strong>discrete</strong></em> family of distributions include the <em><strong>Binomial </strong></em>distribution, the <em><strong>Poisson</strong> </em>Distribution, the <em><strong>Geometric</strong><strong> </strong></em>distribution, and the <em><strong>Hyperg</strong><strong>eometric</strong><strong> </strong></em>distribution.
* The <em><strong>continuou</strong></em>s family of distributions include the <em><strong>Normal distribution</strong></em>, the <em><strong>Exponential distribution</strong></em> and the <em><strong>Continuous Uniform</strong></em> Distribution
* <em>(Remark: There are other distributions in both families, but are not considered here).</em>
* In addtion to studying the distributions, we will look at how some distributions can be used to approximate others, in particular the<em><strong>Poisson Approximation of the Binomial Distribution.</strong></em>

<h5>About Probability Distributions</h5>

In probability and statistics, a probability distribution assigns a probability to each measurable subset of the possible outcomes of a random experiment, survey, or procedure of statistical inference.

Examples are found in experiments whose sample space is non-numerical, where the distribution would be a categorical distribution; experiments whose sample space is encoded by discrete random variables, where the distribution can be specified by a probability mass function; and experiments with sample spaces encoded by continuous random variables, where the distribution can be specified by a probability density function.

More complex experiments, such as those involving stochastic processes defined in continuous time, may demand the use of more general probability measures.
