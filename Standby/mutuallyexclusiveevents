\begin{itemize}
\item In a given observation or experiment, an event must either occur or not occur. \item Therefore, the sum of the
probability of occurrence plus the probability of nonoccurrence always equals 1. \item Thus, where $A^{\prime}$ indicates the nonoccurrence of event A, we have
$P(A) + P(A^{c}) =  1$

\item 
Two or more events are mutually exclusive, or disjoint, if they cannot occur together. That is, the occurrence
of one event automatically precludes the occurrence of the other event (or events). 
\item For instance, suppose we
consider the two possible events ``ace" and ``king" with respect to a card being drawn from a deck of playing
cards. 
\item These two events are mutually exclusive, because any given card cannot be both an ace and a king.
\item Two or more events are nonexclusive when it is possible for them to occur together.

\item Note that this definition does not indicate that such events must necessarily always occur jointly. For instance, suppose we consider the two possible events ``ace" and ``spade". 
\item These events are not mutually exclusive, because a given card can be both an ace and a spade; however, it does not follow that every ace is a spade or every spade is an ace.
\end{itemize}

\noindent \textbf{Mutually Exclusive Events}

\begin{itemize}
\item Suppose you roll a 6 sided die. \item Let \textbf{A} be the event that the number is odd and \textbf{B} be the event that the number is even. 
\item Since the die is only rolled once, it is impossible for the number that lands face up is both odd and even. \item The events \textbf{A} and \textbf{B} are said to be mutually exclusive events. \item If two events cannot happen at the same time, they are said to be mutually exclusive.


\item Two events are \textbf{mutually exclusive} if they cannot occur together. 
\item Another way of expressing mutually events is \textbf{disjoint} events.
\item If two events are mutually exclusive, then the probability of them both occurring at the same time is 0.
Disjoint:  \[P(A \cap B) = 0\]
\end{itemize}



\section{Mutually Exclusive Events}
\begin{itemize}
\item Two events are mutually exclusive (or disjoint) if it is impossible for
them to occur together.
\item Formally, two events $A$ and $B$ are mutually exclusive if and only if
$A\cap B$ = $\varnothing$ \end{itemize}\bigskip
Consider our die example
\begin{itemize} 
\item Event A = `observe an odd number' = $\{1,3,5\}$
\item Event B = `observe an even number' = $\{2,4,6\}$

\item $A\cap B$ = $\varnothing$ (i.e. the empty set), so $A$ and $B$ are mutually exclusive.
\end{itemize}
