\section{Bayes' Theorem}
Bayes' Theorem is a result that allows new information to be used to update the conditional probability of an event.
\bigskip

Recall the definition of conditional probability:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)} \]


Using the multiplication rule, gives Bayes' Theorem in its simplest form:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)\times P(A)}{P(B)} \]
