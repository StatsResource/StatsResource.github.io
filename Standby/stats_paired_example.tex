\subsection*{Example}


Ten soldiers visit the rifle range on two different weeks. The first
week their scores are:


$\{67, 24, 57, 55, 63, 54, 56, 68, 33, 43\}$


The second week they score
$\{70, 38, 58, 58, 56, 67, 68, 77, 42, 38\}$


Give a 95\% confidence interval for the improvement in scores from week one to
week two.



%-------------------------------------------------------------%



This is a case of paired samples, for the scores are repeated observations for each
soldier, and there is good reason to think that the soldiers will differ from each other
in their shooting skill. So we work with the individual differences between the scores.
We shall have to assume that the pairwise differences are a random sample from a
normal distribution.


The differences are:


$\{3, 14, 1, 3, -7, 13, 12, 9, 9, -5\}$



%-------------------------------------------------------------%



Effectively we now have a single sample of size 10, and want a 95\% confidence
interval for the mean of the population from which these differences are drawn. For
this we use a Student's $t$ interval. The sample mean of the differences is 5.2, and
$s^2$ = 54.84. So $s = 7.41$, and the 95\% $t$ interval for the difference in the means is
$5.2 - 2.26(7.41)/\sqrt{10},  5.2 + 2.26(7.41)/\sqrt{10} = (.0.1, 10.5)$.
