Line Diagrams are technically known as \emph{historiograms}. 
For comparison purposes, several
line diagrams can be drawn on the same set of axes 
(sometimes known as \emph{multiple line diagrams}).

\subsection*{Time Series :  Additive Models}
\[ y=t+s+r \]
\begin{itemize}
\item $y$ is a given time series value,
\item $t$ is the trend component
\item $s$ is the seasonal component
\item $r$ is the residual component
\end{itemize}
The multiplicative Model is given as
\[ y=t+s+r \]

\subsection*{Index number notation}
A price index measures percentage changes in the value of some economic quantity over a period of time.

\begin{itemize}
\item $p_o$ is the price at the \emph{base} time point,
\item $p_n$ is the price at some other time point (i.e. time point $n$),
\item $q_o$ is the quantity at the \emph{base} time point,
\item $q_n$ is the quantity at some other time point (i.e. time point $n$).
