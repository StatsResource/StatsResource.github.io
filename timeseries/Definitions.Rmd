### Defintions


<h4> Autocorrelation function</h4>
The autocovariance function is measured in squared units, so that the values obtained depend on the absolute size of the measurements. We can make this quantity
independent of the absolute sizes of xn by defining a dimensionless quantity, the autocorrelation function.

The autocorrelation function (ACF) of a stationary process is defined by: $k=corr(xt,xt+k)=k0$
The ACF of a purely indeterministic process satisfies k as k .

<h4>Autoregressive model</h4>
The notation AR(p) refers to the autoregressive model of order p. The AR(p) model is defined as

<h4>Backwards shift operator and difference operator</h4>

The backwards shift operator, B, acts on the process X to give a process BX such that: (BX)t=Xt-1

If we apply the backwards shift operator to a constant, then it doesn’t change it: B=

The difference operator, , is defined as = 1- B , or in other words: (X)t=Xt-Xt-1

Both operators can be applied repeatedly. For example:

	(B2X)t=(B(BX))t=(BX)t-1=Xt-2

	(2X)t= (X)t- (X)t-1=Xt-2Xt-1+Xt-2

<h4>Lag Operator</h4>
In time series analysis, the lag operator or backshift operator operates on an element of a time series to produce the previous element. 

For example, given some time series X={X1,X2,} then LXt=Xt-1  for all   where L is the lag operator

<h4>Ljung-Box test statistic</h4>
 
\[Q=T(T+2)k=1srk2/(T-k)\]
 
T = number of observations
s = number of coefficients to test autocorrelation
rk = autocorrelation coefficient (for lag k)
Q = portmanteau test statistic.

<h4>Moving Average Models</h4>
The moving average (MA) model is common approach for modeling univariate time series models. 
\[Xt=+t+1t-1++qt-q\]
