\noindent \textbf{Simpsons Paradox}
\begin{itemize}
\item The nature of an association between two traits may change and
even reverse direction when the data from several groups is
combined into a single group.
For example, consider the following data regarding admissions to a
university.
\item The Physics department accepted 60 applications from 100 males
and 20 applications from 30 females.
\item The Fine Arts department accepted 10 applications from 100
males and 30 applications from 170 females.

\begin{itemize}
\item Hence, the Physics department accepted 60\% of applications from
males and 66.7\% of applications from females. 
\item The Fine Arts
department accepted 10\% of applications from males and 17.6\% of
applications from females.
\item Hence, in both departments females are slightly more successful.

\noindent \textbf{Simpsons Paradox}
\begin{itemize}
\item Combining the departments, we obtain the following contingency
\item Combining the results females are less successful.
\item We now test the null hypothesis that acceptance is independent of
sex. 
\item The alternative is that acceptance is associated with sex (i.e.
the likelihood of acceptance depends on sex).

Testing the null hypothesis at the 5\% level, the critical value is
$\chi^2_{(
r-1)(c-1),)}$ = $\chi^2_{(1,0.05)}$ = 3.841.
Since t > $\chi^2_{(1,0.05)}$ = 3.841, we reject the null hypothesis.
\begin{itemize}
\item We conclude that acceptance is associated with sex. Looking at
the table which compares the observed and expected values,
females are less likely to be accepted than expected.
\item Hence, using this data we might conclude that there is evidence
that females are discriminated against.

\begin{itemize}
\item However, in both departments a female is more likely to be
accepted.
\item On average, females are less likely to be accepted since they are
more likely to apply to the fine arts department and the fine arts
department rejects a higher proportion of applications.

\noindent \textbf{Lurking variables}
In this case department is what we call a hidden or lurking variable.
A hidden or lurking variable is a variable which may influence the
observed results, but is not considered in the analysis.
For example, women’s salaries are significantly lower on average
that men’s salaries.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Can this be used as evidence that women are
discriminated against?
\item What are the lurking variables which may explain
such a difference?
\item How should we test whether females are
discriminated against with regard to salary?
\end{enumerate}
