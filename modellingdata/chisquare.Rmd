### Chi Square Tests
<strong>There are two types of Chi-Square Test</strong>

Testing Goodness of Fit

A Chi Square Test is often used to measure a goodness of fit between an observed and expected distribution of values. Knowing how to perform a Chi Square Test can be useful for testing probable to expected outcomes, fitting points to a curve, or testing a statistical hypothesis.

<strong>2.  Chi square test of independence</strong>

If the columns are not contingent on the rows, then the rows and column frequencies are independent. The test of whether the columns are contingent on the rows is called the chi square test of independence. The null hypothesis is that there is no relationship between row and column frequencies.


### Chi Square Testing for Goodness of Fit

<h5> Testing Goodness of Fit</h5>


Contingency tables are used to examine the relationship between subjects’ scores on two categorical variables.

<h5>Chi square test of independence</h5>

If the columns are not contingent on the rows, then the rows and column frequencies are independent. The test of whether the columns are contingent on the rows is called the chi square test of independence. The null hypothesis is that there is no relationship between row and column frequencies.

### Worked Examples

#### Worked Examples 1
 
One of the questions on a business magainzes subscribers only study was:

"In the past 12 months, when travelling for business, what types of airline tickets did you purchase most often?"

The data obtained are show in the table below
  
| | | Domestic Flight | International Flight| |
|:------:|:------:|:------:|:------:|:------:|
| | First Class | 65 | 55 ||
| |Business Class / Executive | 140 | 100||
| | Economy |520|120||  

<h5> Exercises </h5> 
* Using a 5% significance level, test for the independence of type of flight and type of ticket. What is your conclusion?
