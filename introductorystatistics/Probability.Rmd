### Probability

<h5> Probability </h5>

* Probability theory is the mathematical study of randomness. A
probability model of a random experiment is defined by assigning
probabilities to all the different outcomes.
* Probability is a numerical measure of the likelihood that an event will
occur. Thus, probabilities can be used as measures of degree of
uncertainty associated with outcomes of an experiment.
Probability values are always assigned on a scale from 0 to 1.
* A probability of 0 means that the event is impossible, while
a probability near 0 means that it is highly unlikely to occur.
* Similarly an event with probability 1 is certain to occur, whereas an
event with a probability near to 1 is very likely to occur.


### Conditional Probability

<h3>Conditional Probability</h3>

The conditional probability of an event is the probability that an event A occurs given that another event B has already occurred. This type of probability is calculated by restricting the sample space that weâ€™re working with to only the set B.

The formula for conditional probability can be rewritten using some basic algebra. Instead of the formula:

\[P(A | B) = \frac{P(A \cap B) }{P( B )}  \]

#### Multiplication Rule
The multiplication rule is a result used to determine the probability that two events, $A$ and $B$, both occur.
The multiplication rule follows from the definition of conditional probability.\\ \bigskip

The result is often written as follows, using set notation:
\[ P(A|B)\times P(B) = P(B|A)\times P(A) \qquad \left( = P(A \cap B) \right) \]


#### Bayes Theorem

Bayes' Theorem is a result that allows new information to be used to update the conditional probability of an event.

Recall the definition of conditional probability:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)} \]




Using the multiplication rule, gives Bayes' Theorem in its simplest form:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)\times P(A)}{P(B)} \]


The general form of Bayes' theorem is
\[ P(A|B) =
\frac{P(A \mbox{ and }B)}{P(B)} \]

Equivalently Bayes' Theorem can be expressed as
\begin{equation*}
P(B|A)=\frac{P\left(A|B\right) \times P(B) }{P\left( A\right) }.
\end{equation*}

### Probability Trees

<h5> Probability Trees </h5>


*  A probability tree diagram shows all the possible events.
*  The first event is represented by a dot.
*  From the dot, branches are drawn to represent all possible outcomes of the event.
*  The probability of each outcome is written on its branch.
*  How do you calculate the overall probabilities?
 *  You multiply probabilities along the branches
 *  You add probabilities down columns
