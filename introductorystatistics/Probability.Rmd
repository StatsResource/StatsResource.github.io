### Probability

<h5> Probability </h5>

* Probability theory is the mathematical study of randomness. A
probability model of a random experiment is defined by assigning
probabilities to all the different outcomes.
* Probability is a numerical measure of the likelihood that an event will
occur. Thus, probabilities can be used as measures of degree of
uncertainty associated with outcomes of an experiment.
Probability values are always assigned on a scale from 0 to 1.
* A probability of 0 means that the event is impossible, while
a probability near 0 means that it is highly unlikely to occur.
* Similarly an event with probability 1 is certain to occur, whereas an
event with a probability near to 1 is very likely to occur.

#### Probability Trees

<h5> Probability Trees </h5>


*  A probability tree diagram shows all the possible events.
*  The first event is represented by a dot.
*  From the dot, branches are drawn to represent all possible outcomes of the event.
*  The probability of each outcome is written on its branch.
*  How do you calculate the overall probabilities?
 *  You multiply probabilities along the branches
 *  You add probabilities down columns
