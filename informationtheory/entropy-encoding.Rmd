\noindent \textbf{Data compression(1)}
Data compression is the science (and art) of representing information in a compact form. Having been the domain of a relatively small group of engineers and scientists, it is now ubiquitous. \\ \bigskip It has been one of the critical enabling technologies for the on-going digital multimedia revolution for decades. Without compression techniques, none of the ever-growing Internet, digital TV, mobile communication or increasing video communication would have been practical developments. \\ \bigskip

\noindent \textbf{Data compression(1)}

Data compression is an active research area in computer science. By "compressing data", we actually mean deriving techniques or, more specifically, designing efficient algorithms to:


\item represent data in a less redundant fashion
\item remove the redundancy in data
\item implement coding, including both encoding and decoding.

### Huffman encoding algorithm 
Huffman coding is an entropy encoding algorithm used for lossless data compression.\\
\bigskip
A frequency based coding scheme (algorithm) that follows Huffman's idea is called Huffman coding. Huffman coding is a simple algorithm that generates a set of variable-size codewords of the minimum average length. The algorithm for Huffman encoding involves the following steps:
<p>
\begin{itemize}
\item[1.] Frequency Table: Constructing a frequency table sorted in descending order.

\item[2.] Building a binary tree:
    Carrying out iterations until completion of a complete binary tree:

\item[(a)] Merge the last two items (which have the minimum frequencies) of    the frequency table to form a new combined item with a sum
    frequency of the two.

\item[(b)] Insert the combined item and update the frequency table.


\item[3.] Deriving Huffman tree:
Starting at the root, trace down to every leaf; mark �0� for a left branch and �1� for a right branch.

\item[4.] Generating Huffman code:
Collecting the 0s and 1s for each path from the root to a leaf and assigning a 0-1 codeword for each symbol.

<p>

Huffman coding is a method of lossless data compression, and a form of entropy encoding. The basic idea is to map an alphabet to a representation for that alphabet, composed of strings of variable size, so that symbols that have a higher probability of occurring have a smaller representation than those that occur less often.

<p>
The key to Huffman coding is Huffman's algorithm, which constructs an extended binary tree of minimum weighted path length from a list of weights. For this problem, our list of weights consists of the probabilities of symbol occurrence. From this tree (which we will call a Huffman tree for convenience), the mapping to our variable-sized representations can be defined.
<p>
The mapping is obtained by the path from the root of the Huffman tree to the leaf associated with a symbol's weight. The method can be arbitrary, but typically a value of 0 is associated with an edge to any left child and a value of 1 with an edge to any right child (or vice-versa). By concatenating the labels associated with the edges that make up the path from the root to a leaf, we get a binary string. Thus the mapping is defined.

<p>
Inverse Mapping}
\begin{itemize}
\item In order to recover the symbols that make up a string from its representation after encoding, an inverse mapping must be possible. It is important that this mapping is unambiguous. \item We can show that all possible strings formed by concatenating any number of path labels in a Huffman tree are indeed unambiguous, due to the fact that it is a complete binary tree. \item That is, given a string composed of Huffman codes, there is exactly one possible way to decompose it into the individual codes.
\end{itemize}

\noindent \textbf{Data compression(2)}
The key approaches of data compression can be summarized as modelling + coding.
Modelling is a process of constructing a knowledge system for
performing compression. Coding includes the design of the code and product of the compact data form.
