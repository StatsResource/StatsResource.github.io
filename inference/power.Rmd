\section{Power} 
The power of a statistical hypothesis test measures the test's ability to reject the null hypothesis when 
it is actually false - that is, to make a correct decision.


In other words, the power of a hypothesis test is the probability of not committing a type II error. 
It is calculated by subtracting the probability of a type II error from 1, usually expressed as: 
Power = 1 - P(type II error) = 1-$\beta$

The maximum power a test can have is 1, the minimum is 0. Ideally we want a test to have high power, close to 1.
