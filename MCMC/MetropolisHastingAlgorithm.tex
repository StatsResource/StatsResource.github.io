\subsection*{Metropolis Hasting Algorithm}
%=======================================================%
This is a rejection sampling algorithm used to generate a sequence of samples 
from a probability distribution function, that is difficult to sample directly from.
This sequence can be used to MCMC simulation to approximate the distribution (e.g. construct a histogram) or compute an integral (e.g. compute an expected value)

Gibbs sampling is usually faster and easier, but less applicable.
