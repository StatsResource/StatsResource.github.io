\subsection{Numerical Quadrature using Pseudo-random numbers}
They are methods of approximate evaluation opf definite integrals, usually multi-dimensional ones.

\theta has a posterios density $g(\theta |y)$

The posterior mean $h(\theta)$ is given by

\[E[h(\theta)|y]  = \int h(\theta) g(\theta|y) d \theta\]

Suppose we have an independent sample 
\[ \theta^{1}, theta^{2}, theta^{3}, \ldots, theta^{n}\]
from posterior density. Then the posterios mean's MC estimate is given by the sample mean

\[ \bar{h}  = \frac{\sum^{m}_{j=1} h(\theta^j) }{m} \]
