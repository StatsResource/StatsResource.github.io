### Nelson-Aalen estimator of the cumulative hazard function

The Nelson-Aalen estimator is a non-parametric estimator of the ***cumulative hazard rate function*** in case of censored data or incomplete data.


It is used in survival theory, reliability engineering and life insurance to estimate the cumulative number of expected events. 


An "event" can be the failure of a non-repairable component, the death of a human being, or any occurrence for which the experimental unit remains in the "failed" state (e.g., death) from the point at which it changed on. 

### Formula 

The Nelson-Aalen estimator is a non-parametric estimator of the cumulative hazard function and is given by:
\[\LARGE \tilde{H}(t)=\sum_{t_i\leq t}\frac{d_i}{n_i},\]
with $\LARGE d_i$ the number of events at $\LARGE t_i$ and $\LARGE n_i$ the total individuals at risk at $t_i$.
where $\LARGE d_i$ is the number who failed out of $\LARGE n_i$ at risk in interval ti.)


----------------------------

The curvature of the Nelson-Aalen estimator gives an idea of the hazard rate shape. A concave shape is an indicator for infant mortality while a convex shape indicates wear out mortality.
It can be used for example when testing the homogeneity of Poisson processes.

------------------------

Because of its simple relationship with the survival function, $\LARGE S(t)=e^{âˆ’H(t)}$ the cumulative hazard function can be used to estimate the survival function. 

The estimator is calculated, then, by summing the proportion of those at risk who failed in each interval up to time t.


###  Worked Examples


<h3> Worked Example</h3>
The Shining Light company has developed a new type of light bulb which it recently
tested. 1,000 bulbs were switched on and observed until they failed, or until 500
hours had elapsed. For each bulb that failed, the duration in hours until failure was
noted. Due to an earth tremor after 200 hours, 200 bulbs shattered and had to be
removed from the test before failure.
The results showed that 
* 10 bulbs failed after 50 hours,
* 20 bulbs failed after 100 hours,
* 50 bulbs failed after 250 hours, 
* 300 bulbs failed after 400 hours,
* 50 bulbs failed
after 450 hours.

<h4> Exercises </h4>
a. Calculate the Kaplan-Meier estimate of the survival function, $\LARGE S(t)$, for the light
bulbs in the test.
b.  Sketch the Kaplan-Meier estimate calculated in part (a).
c. Estimate the probability that a bulb will not have failed after each of the
following durations: 300 hours, 400 hours and 600 hours. If it is not possible
to obtain an estimate for any of the durations without additional assumptions,
explain why.
